<p style="border: 3px inset #a758ecb6; display: inline-flex; padding: 3px; backdrop-filter: blur(0px) saturate(100%) brightness(50%); font-size: 36px; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">I have been toying around with code since roughly 2020-ish. I never really did anything cool until mid-2022, whenever I started my first Minecraft mod, Broken Lead Warner. I had played around with Python, HTML, and JavaScript for a very very small amount of time before then, but had taken Java a little farther. I barely knew what I was doing, but I was set on my current and future ideas. I finished the mod around 3-ish months later. And started right on the next one.</p>

Explosive Enhancement is by far my favorite and my most popular mod on Modrinth. It took only around a week because I had set a deadline for myself to finish it so I could release it on the first day of the new year.</p>

I'm almost done with it, however, and will make an update to this page once it releases.</p>
