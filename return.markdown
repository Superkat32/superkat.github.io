<h1> Are you sure you want to return? </h1>
<h2> Hampter will be very sad if you do... </h2>

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/hampter/" p style="color:lime;">No, I do not wish to upset Hampter, as that is very mean.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}" p style="color:#ed3e52;">Yes... I wish to disapoint Hampter by returning back to the home page, which he does not want of me. This is well beyond a monstrous act as Hampter has not done anything to deserve this. It's almost as if I'm becoming worst than the Grinch ever did. It feels as if it is simply impossible to make up for what I'm about to do to Hampter, as this simply is unacceptable. The consequence of the damage I'm about to cause if I decided I really do wish to return back to the home page will most likely be beyond repair for poor poor Hampter. Hampter will forever remember what I'm about to do, as it'll upset him beyond anything before. However, there may be a silver lining to all of this. Luckily, Hampter will actually forgive me in due time because he is the greatest Hampter known to all of man-kind, but that does not give me the excuse to leave Hampter without a second thought. I believe that Hampter will understand that I need to return back to the homepage, as he can only be a Hacker Hampter for so long...
